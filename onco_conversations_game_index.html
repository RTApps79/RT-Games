The radiation itself is painless, but some people develop skin soreness over time. We'll watch that closely together.", outcome: { E: 5, K: 10, S: -2 }, feedback: "Good. This is honest and sets realistic expectations while still being reassuring." }, { text: "It's a painless process, so there's nothing to be scared of.", outcome: { E: -5, S: 2 }, feedback: "While true, this dismisses the patient's feeling of being scared. Acknowledging their emotion is important." } ] },

You validated their concern, provided a correct explanation, and outlined an action plan." }, { text: "The oncologist said this would happen. You should have been expecting it.", outcome: { E: -15, S: 10 }, feedback: "This response is blaming and lacks empathy, which can damage trust." }, { text: "Let's check it. I'll also make sure the doctor sees it during your weekly visit. In the meantime, are you using the moisturizer as recommended?", outcome: { E: 5, K: 5, S: -3 }, feedback: "Good. This is proactive and reinforces prior education without being dismissive." } ] },
    { difficulty: 'easy', role: 'Preceptor', avatar: '🧐', dialogue: "I see you're taking notes. Do you have any questions about what you're observing?", choices: [ { text: "Yes, I'm a bit confused about why this specific immobilization device was chosen over a standard wingboard.", outcome: { K: 10, S: -5 }, feedback: "Good! Asking specific, relevant questions shows you are engaged and thinking critically." }, { text: "No, everything is clear right now.", outcome: { K: -5, S: 2 }, feedback: "This is a missed opportunity. Preceptors expect questions; not asking any may seem like a lack of interest." }, { text: "Why do we have to use this one? It seems to take longer to set up.", outcome: { E: -5, S: 10 }, feedback: "This question's tone sounds critical rather than curious. Frame questions positively to foster a good relationship." } ] },

What's the standard total dose for a breast boost after WBRT?", choices: [ { text: "Usually it's an additional 10 Gy in 5 fractions, bringing the total to the tumor bed to around 60 Gy.", outcome: { K: 10, S: -5 }, feedback: "Excellent.

Remember, we'll be watching you on camera and can talk to you on the intercom. We're right here.", outcome: { E: 15, S: -10 }, feedback: "Excellent. You've normalized their fear, reminded them of safety systems, and provided strong reassurance." }, { text: "The treatment only takes a few minutes, you'll be out before you know it.", outcome: { E: -5, S: 2 }, feedback: "This minimizes the patient's feelings. While trying to be reassuring, it doesn't directly address their fear of being alone." }, { text: "I understand. Would you like to listen to some music during your treatment? We can put on a favorite radio station or CD for you.", outcome: { E: 10, S: -8 }, feedback: "A great therapeutic response. You've validated their feeling and offered a positive coping mechanism." } ] },

I don't think it's working anyway.", choices: [ { text: "I understand you're feeling discouraged. It's okay to feel that way. Why don't we have you speak with the doctor before we make any decisions?", outcome: { E: 15, K: 5, S: -10 }, feedback: "Perfect. You acknowledged their feelings, respected their autonomy, and followed the correct protocol by involving the physician." }, { text: "You have to have the treatment, it's on the schedule. We can't get behind.", outcome: { E: -15, S: 10 }, feedback: "This violates patient autonomy and focuses on logistics over patient care, causing stress and damaging trust." }, { text: "I hear you, but it's really important to stick with the plan. Let's just get today over with.", outcome: { E: -5, S: 5 }, feedback: "While well-intentioned, this response pressures the patient instead of exploring their concern. Deferring to the physician is the best course of action." } ] },

Could you explain it?", choices: [ { text: "Sure! It's all about the triangulation from the lasers to the tattoos. Let me walk you through how I think about it.", outcome: { K: 10, E: 5, S: -5 }, feedback: "Great teamwork. Explaining a concept solidifies your own knowledge and builds rapport." }, { text: "I'm a little busy right now, maybe ask the preceptor.", outcome: { E: -5, S: 5 }, feedback: "This comes across as unhelpful. Teamwork is essential in a clinical setting." }, { text: "Honestly, I'm a bit shaky on it too. Let's ask the preceptor together so we both get it right.", outcome: { K: 5, E: 10, S: -8 }, feedback: "Excellent response.

Is that going to mess everything up?", choices: [ { text: "We strongly advise against breaking the treatment schedule. It can compromise the effectiveness.", outcome: { E: -10, S: 5 }, feedback: "While true, this response lacks empathy for the patient's difficult situation and may increase their anxiety." }, { text: "Family comes first. I completely understand. Let's talk to the front desk and find the best possible new time. We'll manage this.", outcome: { E: 15, S: -10 }, feedback: "Perfect. You showed empathy, reassured the patient, and directed them to the correct resource for a solution." }, { text: "You'll have to call the schedulers for that. I don't handle the appointments.", outcome: { E: -5, K: -2, S: 2 }, feedback: "This is dismissive. A better response would show more willingness to help, even if you're just pointing them in the right direction." } ] },

It's my chemo day and the oncologist wants them on separate days.", choices: [ { text: "Of course, that's a very common scheduling requirement. Let's get the schedulers to find a new spot for you right away. No problem.", outcome: { E: 10, K: 5, S: -8 }, feedback: "Excellent. You showed immediate understanding of a common clinical constraint and took action." }, { text: "Are you sure? We often do them on the same day.", outcome: { E: -5, K: -5, S: 5 }, feedback: "This questions the patient and the oncologist's directive, undermining trust. It's better to accept and act." }, { text: "Okay, but you need to make sure you call scheduling to sort it out.", outcome: { E: 0, S: 0 }, feedback: "This is a passive response. A more proactive and reassuring approach would be better." } ] },

Should I start?", choices: [ { text: "That's an excellent question. It's really important to discuss any new medications or supplements with the doctor first, because some can interfere with treatment.", outcome: { E: 10, K: 10, S: -5 }, feedback: "Perfect. You empowered the patient to ask questions while giving a safe, correct answer and reinforcing the doctor's role." }, { text: "Whatever you read online is probably wrong. Just stick to what we tell you here.", outcome: { E: -10, S: 5 }, feedback: "This response is condescending and discourages the patient from bringing up valid concerns in the future." }, { text: "Absolutely not. You should never take any supplements during treatment without clearing it with the oncologist first.", outcome: { K: 8, S: -2 }, feedback: "While technically correct, the tone is a bit harsh. A more collaborative approach is better for patient trust." } ] },
